About
=====

This is the repository containing my dotfiles, most notably my vim
configuration.

Installation
============

To install the dotfiles, run `./install.sh` in the root of the repository.
The install script assumes you're not running it from another directory, it
won't work if you do so!

The install script makes simlink from the repository to your home directory
using stow, the purpose being to ease updating. That means you musn't remove
the repository, or you'll have dangling simlinks! If you don't want that
behaviour, copy the files yourself from the repository.
